## Description

This is generic display related functionality. Show info on a screen, LED-display diode, etc.

The [CAN4VSCP New York module](https://www.grodansparadis.com) is an example on the how this can be implemented in a module. 

##### Escape sequences

An escape sequence is preceded with a %. As a result to display **”%”** instead **"%%"** should be used.

The first character after the % is the escape-type. This character is case sensitive. That is “e” is not the same as “E”. 

##### Escape character Description

 | Escape type | Decription | 
 | :-----------: | ---------- | 
 | **$**       | Zero terminated string | 
 | **!**       | Boolean value | 
 | **b**       | signed char | 
 | **B**       | unsigned char | 
 | **s**       | signed short | 
 | **S**       | unsigned short | 
 | **i**       | signed int | 
 | **I**       | unsigned int | 
 | **l**       | signed long | 
 | **L**       | unsigned long | 
 | **f**       | floating point decimal | 
 | **d**       | date format | 
 | **t**       | time | 
 | **n**       | normalized integer | 
 | **p**       | **Parameter data:** Display parameter escapes. The format is <br>**%p001**<br> where “001” is the ID that identifies the parameter. This escape is used for hard parameters displayed by the display maker. Se Type=6 below. | 
 | **e**       | **Event data:** Event data escapes. The format is <br>**%eclass,type,r**<br> where class and type tells which event is of interest and r have the same format as the r escape | 

The above is just a recommendation. Anyone can of course use any format they like.
