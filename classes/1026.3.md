This event, which it is advised that all nodes should implement, can be sent by a server that have lower end nodes connected to it at different interfaces. This can be level II or level I nodes. 

 | Byte    | Description                                                             | 
 | :----:    | -----------                                                             | 
 | 0-15    | Real GUID for node (not interface GUID)                                 | 
 | 16-31   | Reserved                                                                | 
 | 32-47   | GUID for interface on server the node is connected to.                  | 
 | 48      | Interface Level (0=Level I, 1=Level II)                                 | 
 | 49-63   | Reserved                                                                | 
 | 64-127  | Real text name of node (if any). Set to all zero if not available.      | 
 | 128-191 | Real text name of interface (if any). Set to all zero if not available. | 

If the real GUID for a node is not known (for example discovery is in progress or have failed) bytes 0-15 should be set to zero. This is true for a node that has been configured as a known node but where the system has not yet fetched information from the node.
