Signal Quality be used to give an indication of the quality of the digital part as BER (Bit Error Ratio) for example.

 | Data byte | Description                         |
 | :---------: | -----------                       |
 | 0         | Data coding.                        |
 | 1-7       | Data with format defined by byte 0. |

### Coding of units (Level I)

 | Code | Description                                                                                        |
 | :----: | -----------                                                                                        |
 | 0    | 0-100, Percent                                                                                     |
 | 1    | **Byte count = 2**: Min = 0, Max = 255  **Byte count = 3**: Min = 0, Max = 65535  and so on... |
 | 2    | dBm  |
 | 3    | To be defined |

Units for Level II are the same as for Level I for the first four units.
