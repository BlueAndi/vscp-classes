A level II node should send this event at least once a minute to indicate that it is live and well. The implementation **is mandatory**. Recommended interval is 30-60 seconds but in a node that need to sleep longer to save resources a longer interval can be used.

 | Byte | Description                 | 
 | :----: | -----------                 | 
 | 0-63 | Real text name of the node. | 

This event is sent by all level nodes even if they are just a client which can connect to a server but not accept connections itself.
