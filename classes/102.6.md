With this call a display buffer parameter can be sent to a display. This parameter is inserted at the escape position %pn in the string in the buffer *when the buffer is transferred to the display*.

Note that there are no zone and sub-zone defined for this event and the escapes must instead be chosen to be distinct in a system. This means that &p1 will be unique within a system and updating this parameter will update on all displays that has it defined.
