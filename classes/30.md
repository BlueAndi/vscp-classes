## Description

Control functionality. One of the main concepts of VSCP is that it is an event driven protocol. Commands are sent out as events to the network not as events to specific devices. A device can belong to a zone which select limit events of interest for the particular node.. If there is a need to control a specific device the registry model should be used. This is the only way to directly control a device.
