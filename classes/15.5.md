Signal Level is a relative strength value that (as default) has its maximum at 100 and minimum at 0 interpreted as a percentage. For a digital transmission Signal Level it can be used to give an indication of the analogue signal and [CLASS1.DATA, Type = 6, Signal Quality](./class1.data.md#type6) can be used to give an indication of the quality of the digital part as BER (Bit Error Ratio) for example.

 | Data byte | Description                         | 
 | :---------: | -----------                         | 
 | 0         | Data coding.                        | 
 | 1-7       | Data with format defined by byte 0. | 

### Coding of units (Level I)
 | Code | Description                                                                                        | 
 | :----: | -----------                                                                                        | 
 | 0    | (0-100) percentage.                                                                               | 
 | 1    | **Byte count = 2**: Min = 0, Max = 255<br>**Byte count = 3**: Min = 0, Max = 65535<br>  and so on... | 


Units for Level II are the same as for Level I for the first four units.
