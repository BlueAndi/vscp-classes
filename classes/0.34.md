**Mandatory** for nodes with a decision matrix

Report the size for the decision matrix and the offset to its storage. The reported size is the number of decision matrix lines. The offset is the offset in the register address counter from 0x00 (See the register model in this document). If the size returned is zero the node does not have a decision matrix. A node without a decision matrix can also skip to implement this event but it's better if it returns a decision matrix size of zero. 

 | Data byte | Description | 
 | :---------: | ----------- | 
 | 0  | Matrix size (number of rows). Zero for a device with no decision matrix. | 
 | 1 | Offset in register space. | 
 | 2 | Optional page start MSB ( Interpret as zero if not sent ) | 
 | 3 | Optional page start LSB ( Interpret as zero if not sent ) | 
 | 4 | Optional page end MSB ( Interpret as zero if not sent ) Deprecated. Set to zero. | 
 | 5 | Optional page end LSB ( Interpret as zero if not sent ) Deprecated. Set to zero. | 
 | 6 | For a Level II node this is the size of a decision matrix row. | 

The decision matrix can as noted be stored in paged registers and if so it must be accessed with the paged read/write. The decision matrix can also be stored indexed. In that case the first byte is the index and the second is the data. If the index is in location 0x7f then an indexed matrix is assumed. 

 | Register position | Description | 
 | :-----------------: | -----------  | 
 | 0x77 | Index for row in decision matrix. | 
 | 0x78-0x7F | Level I decision matrix row. |
