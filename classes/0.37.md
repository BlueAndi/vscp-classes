**Mandatory.** Must be implemented by all devices.

Read a register from a node with page information.

Implementation must take care so all page register change done by these routines must restore the content of the page registers to there original content when they are done. 

 | Data byte | Description | 
 | :---------: | ----------- | 
 | 0 | Node address. | 
 | 1 | MSB of page where the register is located. | 
 | 2 | LSB of page where the register is located. | 
 | 3 | Register to read (offset into page). | 
 | 4 | Optional: Number of registers to read.     | 

If the number of registers to read is set to zero 256 registers will be read. __Some nodes my have small buffers so this bursts of messages may be a problem.__

An extended read/write response event is returned on success.

This means that a register (or a maximum of 256 consecutive registers) located on any page can be read in a single operation.

The following format can be used for nodes on a Level II segment as a midway between a full Level II handling as specified in Class=1024 and Level I. 

 | Data byte | Description | 
 | :---------: | ----------- | 
 | 0-15 | GUID. | 
 | 16 | MSB of page where the register is located. | 
 | 17 | LSB of page where the register is located. | 
 | 18  | Register to read. | 
 | 19   | Optional: bytes to read (1-255). |
