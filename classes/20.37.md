This event is used for cards, RFID's, iButtons, GSM phones and other identification devices. The event is generated when the token device is attached/detached to/from the system. Level II has a counterpart to this event that can take more data. CLASS2.INFORMATION Type=1

Depending on the Token device type a number of this event are sent on the segment with frame index increase for each event. The total expected number can be deduced from the type.
