## Description

For Level I events class=0 defines protocol control functionality. All events of this class are repeated at class=512 for use on Level II networks. The only difference is that the GUID is used instead of the Level I nickname.

This class defines protocol functionality for Level II. To simplify the handling of level II events, the data portion of the VSCP event can be considered as being made up of two parts. An 8-byte code portion (size of long integer) followed by a data portion if required. This is simply done to make processing level II events a little easier. The following events have been added to the level II control events to support configuration management.
